<h2>Full Papers</h2>

<strong>Understanding the Effect of In-Video Prompting on Learners and Instructors</strong><br/>
Hyungyu Shin, Eun Young Ko, Joseph Jay Williams, Juho Kim.<br/>
<em>Tuesday 9am @ 517D: Learning and Training</em><br/>
"With in-video prompting, learners answer reflective questions
while watching videos. What do learners and instructors think about it? How can we design a meaningful learning experience for learners while giving valuable feedback to instructors?"

<strong>Enhancing Online Problems Through Instructor-Centered Tools for Randomized Experiments</strong><br/>
Joseph Jay Williams, Anna Rafferty, Dustin Tingley, Andrew Ang, Walter Lasecki, Juho Kim<br/>
<em>Tuesday 11am @ 518C: Automated and Crowd Supports for Learning</em><br/>
"Most online instructors lack the expertise and tools to design and run experiments. DynamicProblem helps online instructors to author randomized experiments on explanations, hints, feedback messages, etc. with a simple UI & interpretable machine learning."

<strong>Collaborative Dynamic Queries: Supporting Distributed Small Group Decision-making</strong><br/>
Sungsoo (Ray) Hong, Minhyang (Mia) Suh, Nathalie Henry Riche, Jooyoung Lee, Juho Kim, Mark Zachry<br/>
<em>Tuesday 2pm @ 516C: Distributed Work</em><br/>
"In small group decision making, what if everyone's preferences on decision criteria are easily collected, shared, and filtered? Meet Collaborative Dynamic Queries (CDQ), a UI componenet that improves communication effectiveness & efficiency."

<strong>BebeCode: Collaborative Child Development Tracking System</strong><br/>
Seokwoo Song, Juho Kim, Bumsoo Kang, Wonjeong Park, John Kim<br/>
<em>Wednesday 9am @ 518AB: Children, Well-being, and Play</em><br/>

Minsuk Chang, Leonore Guillain, Hyeungshik Jung, Vivian Hare, Juho Kim, Maneesh Agrawala.<br/>
<em>Thursday 9am @ 516E: Crowdsourcing, Data Mining, Dealing with Information</em><br/>

<strong>To Distort or Not to Distort: Distance Cartograms in the Wild</strong><br/>
Sungsoo (Ray) Hong, Minjoon Yoo, Bonnie Chinh, Amy Han, Sarah Battersby, Juho Kim<br/>
<em>Thursday 2pm @ 518C: Visualization of Space and Shape</em><br/>
"What if your map is rendered based on travel time rather than distance? How does this 'distorted map' affect users' location decision making experience when used in the wild?"

Kyungje Jo, John Joon Young Chung, Juho Kim.<br/>
<em>LBW057. Tuesday 15:20pm @ 220BC Exhibit Hall</em><br/>
