Slide-based lecture video presents unique opportunities for video interaction techniques as its content (image, text, explanation) can be computationally retrieved from the raw pixel and audio of the video. With such a discrete representation of the lecture video, we can improve the watching experience of learners by highlighting the current part of the lecture, enabling text-based navigation and highlight. We also aim to improve the editing experience of lecture video by supporting direct update of the content of the video without patching and re-rendering the original video.
