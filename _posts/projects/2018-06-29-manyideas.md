Many Ideas is a crowd-civic system in which members of a community engage with each other to collect issues, generate ideas, and discuss matters of concern.
The system acts as a testbed for researching new design to increase diverse participation. In our first study, we investigated the effect of personalized motivation-supportive messages.

**Design goals**

- Creating a positive environment
- Defining and achieving real impact
- Personalized motivation support: Everyone is motivated in different ways, but most applications are built with a certain population in mind. We are employing findings from the Self-determination theory to better support individual motivations.
