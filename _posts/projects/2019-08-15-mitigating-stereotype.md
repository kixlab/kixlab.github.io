Listening to a wide range of opinions is a virtue for healthy discussion. However, in online space like discussion forum or social media, people can easily filter out perspectives challenging their prior viewpoints. Such filtering is facilitated by people's stereotypes on people with opposing viewpoints, such as prevalent images on Democrats or Republicans in case of U.S. politics.  

We think people can listen to others with different opinions by reducing stereotypes on them. Based on previous work on mitigating stereotypes from social psychology, we are designing an interactive online system that uses diverse identities of the discussion participants, from demographic ones like age or gender to self-stated identities. With such identities, the user of the system can discover that the opponents have various background beyond their stereotypes. We expect that such intervention can help the users to listen to the people with different opinions more.
